# M3OEP-lcasey1

Liam Casey

no installtions necesary to run the program 
programmed the project using css, html, php, python, and c++
information is passed from php to c++ and then back to php and then to python

This project is a vermont history tester website that tests your briefly knowledge of vermont history and prints out a piechart showing the results of your test. The website is rendered with html and styled with css, when the user chooses their answers to the quiz and hit submit, the results are taken to c++ and evaluated to be correct or incorrect. The correct count is then taken to python where it is graphed in the form of a pie chart. 

The c++ to python transtion I was never able to succesfully debug although both work fine on their own the piechart.py works fine and the c++ also executes succesfully however passing information was not succesful for the c++ to python transition

I would like to expand the program to allow for a more extensive test and perhaps include some text input in the php.

The Grade I think I earned is _____ based on the rubric, I did not have a main program for this project as it was not necesary. I think 20 point for the c++ and python program respectively is appropriate as both are fully functional on their own. as well as 10 for the 2 html, css and php files respectively. aswell as 2 for the argument passing between php and css and 2 for c++ passing it back to php.
